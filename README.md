## Usage

In order to launch the website click the link above.

You will be presented with an introduction screen, click the 'Start Game' button to proceed to the quiz

Continue answering all quiz questions as fast as you can. For every incorrect answer, your timer will decrease by 5. For every wrong or right answer the screen will react with colors with red representing wrong and green right.

Once the 5 questions are completed you score will equal the amount of time left and you will be asked to input your initials.

After inputting your initials a high score table will be generated. You can then choose to restart the quiz.
